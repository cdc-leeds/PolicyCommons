*** 	Cohere Website - version 2 - released 28th May 2010		***

UPDATE NOTES

If you are updating from version 1 of the Cohere website you need to pay 
particular attention to the database.

We have had a cleanup of database Table names and columns, particularly when
we added Tagging (as the idea table was called Tag!).

You will see that the install folder is much simplified.
We have removed the various and confusing update files and other sql files 
and just updated the main db.sql.
So for this release, you will need to check the differences yourself. Sorry.

In the next release, we will add an update.sql file into the install folder with any 
changes between this and the next release will be listed so it is easier for you to update.
